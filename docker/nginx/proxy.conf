## proxy.conf (deprecated)
# This file was added during troubleshooting to provide an nginx reverse-proxy
# configuration. The proxy service has been removed and the compose file reverted
# to the original layout. Keep this file only for reference or remove it if not
# needed.

# Original proxy config (removed): proxy /api -> webapi:5297 and / -> webadmins:80
